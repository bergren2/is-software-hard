# Is Software Hard?

This site was inspired by [Should I use tables for layout?](http://shouldiusetablesforlayout.com) and the following Donald Knuth quote:

> In fact, my main conclusion after spending ten years of my life working on the TEX project is that software is hard. It's harder than anything else I've ever had to do.
